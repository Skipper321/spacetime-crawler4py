# Intro
This is simply a markdown file that I (Julie Bui) created in order to keep track of some of the tasks that we can work on Please feel free to add more if you would like to! You can preview this document (formatted) by opening it on Github or previewing it within VSCode.

## To do (higher priority)
1. Simhashing to prevent similar content 
2. Add sitemaps and robots.txt to the scraper

## To do (medium priority)
1. Look at the doku.php link and filter out unnecessary parts (mainly wiki.ics.edu links)

2. Look for traps
